### Labels description:
###     grade: the final grade (rounded up to 0.25). 
### 
###     exact: the exact grade (5.0 * NUM_POINTS / MAX_POINTS + 1.0)
###            displayed on 2 decimals.
### 
###     grant: partial or full marks (displayed on 3 decimals) granted by 
###            the automatic grading tool or by the corrector.
### 
###            Corrector-granted points always override automatic ones.
### 
###     NUM_POINTS: the number of correct answers + the granted points
###     MAX_POINTS: the maximum number of points (here, 8)    
### 
### Answers fixed automatically (swap):
### 
###     Correct answers that were swapped are given full marks, unless
###     they need some fixing or patching (see below).
### 
### Answers fixed automatically (match):
### 
###     An answer "x" that does not match a solution "y" receives partial 
###     mark if there exists `F = (F1, F2)` such that `F1(x) = F2(y)`.
### 
###     Sometimes, we allow the match up to some threshold D for the edit 
###     distance d = levenshtein(F1(x), F2(y))) (i.e. number of characters
###     to edit to go from one string to the other). The partial mark is  
###     computed as max(0, 1 - d * t), where `t` depends on the strategy
###     used for correcting the answer. 
### 
###     Autofixed errors are reported as "strategy-edit(d)" and the marks
###     that were given are reported as well.
### 
###     Stragey: str
###         Attempt to remove bytes prefixes from a string.
### 
###         Full marks are granted if the cleaned strings match.
###         Otherwise, they are matched with D = 0 and t = 1/4. 
### 
###     Stragey: b64
###         Attempt to encode or decode to base64.
### 
###         Full marks are granted if two encodings or decodings matched.
###         Otherwise, they are matched with D = 0 and t = 1/8. 
### 
### Patched answers:
### 
###     Patched answers are incorrect answers that cannot be easily fixed.
###     New solution candidates are internally generated and compared with
###     the given answer. Full marks are usually not granted.
### 
###     Patched answers are reported as "patched answer [patch: PATCH]"
###     or "patch answer [swapped: ..., patch: PATCH]" if a swap needed
###     to be done beforehand.
